## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### User Story Completion Order
1. **US1 (Non-Interactive)** ‚Üí **US3 (Safety)** ‚Üí **US2 (Interactive)** ‚Üí **US4 (Context)** ‚Üí **US5 (Tools)** ‚Üí **US6 (Providers)**

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)
- Phase 1-4 (Setup + Foundation + US1 + US3)
- Delivers: `mentat run` with safety validation
- Success criteria: T001-T037 complete

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Foundation Phase (T006-T019)**:
- Storage, VCS, Provider interfaces can be developed in parallel
- Safety patterns and approval systems are independent
- Data models independent of interface implementations

**Within User Story 1 (T020-T028)**:
- DTOs, handlers, and providers can be developed in parallel
- Output formatters independent of core logic
- Tests can be written in parallel with implementation

**Within User Story 3 (T029-T037)**:
- Validation, configuration, and UI components are independent
- Safety logging separate from core validation
- Tests can be developed in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelization**:
- After Foundation: US1, US3 can be developed simultaneously (different modules)
- After US1+US3: US2, US4 can be developed simultaneously
- US5, US6 can be developed in parallel (different abstraction layers)

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before phase completion
- MyPy type checking clean for each phase
- Ruff linting clean for each phase
- Integration tests validate interface contracts
- Acceptance tests verify user story completion

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Foundation First**: Complete Phase 2 entirely before user stories
2. **MVP Delivery**: Focus on US1+US3 for immediate value
3. **Incremental Growth**: Add user stories in priority order
4. **Parallel Development**: Use [P] markers for concurrent work
5. **Independent Testing**: Each user story testable in isolation
