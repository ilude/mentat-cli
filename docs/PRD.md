# ðŸ§  Mentat CLI â€“ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
**Mentat CLI** is a terminal-based AI development assistant designed to provide a conversational interface for software development tasks â€” code generation, refactoring, analysis, and project automation â€” entirely from the command line. It brings the intelligence of LLM-based assistants directly into the developer workflow while maintaining strong principles of openness, modularity, and safety.

---

## 2. Goals and Principles
- **Open by Design:** Mentat is modular and open source, allowing users to self-host and extend it.
- **Abstraction over Implementation:** Subsystems (storage, version control, LLM providers, etc.) are abstracted behind interfaces to enable pluggable implementations.
- **Shell-Native:** Operates as a CLI first; no dependency on proprietary IDEs.
- **Secure by Default:** Commands and edits are always verified before execution.
- **Context-Aware:** Understands project structure and session context to reason about codebases holistically.
- **Composable & Extensible:** Integrates external tools and workflows via a standard protocol.
- **Human-Centric Control:** Users maintain complete control over when and how Mentat acts.

## 3. Core Functional Areas

### 3.1 Session Context & Storage
- Maintains a context of prior interactions within a project session.
- Context is persisted locally, with a **swappable storage backend**:
  - Default: file-based storage  
  - Alternatives: SQLite, Postgres, ChromaDB, or S3-compatible object storage
- A storage interface abstraction allows developers to plug in their own engine.

### 3.2 Version Control Awareness
- Aware of `.git` directories, branches, and commit state.
- Version control integration is **not hard-coded to Git** â€” Mentat provides an abstract `VCS` interface.
- Default implementation detects and uses Git; users can implement alternatives.

### 3.3 Command Execution & Safety
- Can execute shell commands and modify files.
- **Regex/Glob-Based Validation:** All commands validated through regex/glob pattern matching.
- **Approval Persistence:** Users can approve a command **once**, for the **current session**, or **permanently**.
- **Safety Modes:**
  - `auto`: executes pre-approved or matching commands automatically
  - `confirm`: prompts for approval before executing any command (default)
  - `readonly`: disables all destructive actions
- This formalizes prior discussions (VS Code-style command matching) and mirrors safety controls seen in Codex/Claude.

### 3.4 Interactive and Non-Interactive Modes
#### Interactive Mode (TUI)
- `mentat chat` launches a **terminal UI (TUI)** for multi-turn interaction.
- Displays conversation history, context summary, and code diffs.
- Users can accept, reject, or edit suggestions inline.
- Session persists until manually closed.

#### Non-Interactive (Script) Mode
- `mentat run "..."` executes a **single prompt non-interactively**.
- Outputs structured results (JSON, text, or markdown).
- Flags for automation:
  - `--output`: write results to file
  - `--format`: choose output format (`json`, `md`, `text`)
  - `--quiet`: suppress extra logs for CI/CD integration

### 3.5 Extensibility via Mentat Tool Server Protocol (MTSP)
- Introduces a standard for external integrations (conceptually similar to MCP).
- Tools (linters, test runners, API scanners, etc.) are registered in `.mentat/tools.json`.

  **Example:**
  ```
  {
    "tools": [
      { "name": "snyk", "command": "snyk test", "description": "Security scan" },
      { "name": "pytest", "command": "pytest --maxfail=1", "description": "Run tests" }
    ]
  }
  ```

- Mentat can discover, invoke, and interpret tool output.
- Enables community-driven extensions and automation beyond built-in capabilities.

### 3.6 Model and Provider Abstraction
- LLM interface is abstracted to support multiple providers.
- Default provider: OpenAI-compatible API.
- Optional providers: Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), local models (Ollama, LM Studio).
- Provider selection configurable via `.mentat/config.json`.

### 3.7 Multimodal Input (Deferred Feature)
- Architecture reserves an interface for multimodal input (images, diagrams, screenshots).
- **Deferred for v1.0**, but a placeholder API will exist.
- Intended use case: screenshots of UI bugs/design issues to guide code fixes during future iterations.

### 3.8 Project Manifest (`AGENT.md`)
- Mentat supports the emerging **`AGENT.md` industry standard** for defining project-specific behavior, style, and goals.
- When present in a repository, this file is automatically parsed and injected into Mentatâ€™s contextual understanding at session start.

**Example:**
```
# AGENT.md
name: Mentat CLI
description: AI-assisted development environment
languages: [python, go]
style: "functional + typed"
rules:
  - Document all public methods
  - Prefer dependency injection
context:
  - Use SQLite by default
  - Avoid global state
```
- Parsed at initialization if present in project root.
- Overrides or augments `.mentat/config.json`.
- Supports YAML or Markdown front-matter syntax.

### 3.9 Prompt Templates (`prompt.md` / Slash Commands)
- Mentat supports reusable **Prompt Templates** defined as Markdown files under `.mentat/prompts/`.
- Each template may be invoked using `/command` syntax in interactive mode (e.g., `/review`, `/test`).

**Example structure:**
```
.mentat/
â””â”€â”€ prompts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ review.prompt.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ test.prompt.md
    â””â”€â”€ doc.prompt.md
```
- Compatible with VS Code Copilotâ€™s `prompt.md` approach.
- Templates can include placeholders (`{{file}}`, `{{branch}}`) replaced at runtime.
- Templates are discoverable via `mentat commands list`.

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Modular Layers
1. **Command Layer** â€” CLI entrypoints (`mentat chat`, `mentat run`, `mentat tool list`)
2. **Core Engine** â€” Message parsing, prompt assembly, session context
3. **Storage Interface** â€” Abstract persistence (local, DB, or remote)
4. **VCS Interface** â€” Abstracted version control integration
5. **Safety Layer** â€” Regex matching, approvals, policy enforcement
6. **Model Provider Interface** â€” Connections to LLM APIs
7. **Tool Server Layer (MTSP)** â€” Invokes external commands via a standard protocol

### 4.2 Configuration Hierarchy
- **Global config:** `~/.mentat/config.json`
- **Project config:** `.mentat/config.json`
- **Runtime overrides:** environment variables and CLI flags

### 4.3 Agent Workflow Model (Reasonâ€“Actâ€“Verify Loop)
- Mentat executes all major actions through a **structured reasoning cycle**:
  1. **Reason** â€” Interpret user intent, gather relevant context (files, history, AGENT.md).
  2. **Act** â€” Perform generation, file edits, or tool invocations.
  3. **Verify** â€” Evaluate results, summarize actions, and request user approval when needed.
- This ensures transparency, reproducibility, and safe iterative improvement of generated code.

## 7. Competitive Positioning
Mentat CLI draws from the strengths of industry peers:
- **Codex CLI:** safety modes and agent manifests  
- **Claude Code:** slash commands and tool integration  
- **Gemini CLI:** open-source ReAct agent architecture  
- **Copilot:** IDE-level refinement and multi-file awareness  
- **OpenCode:** TUI-first, provider-agnostic design  

Mentatâ€™s differentiation: a **fully open, extensible, self-hostable CLI platform** that emphasizes developer autonomy and safety.
